# Project 3 - Random Quote & English Word with Definition Using ReactJS 18 🚀
## Beginner level

- Using external APIs and making HTTP requests are an essential part of any React application. To learn how to make HTTP requests in React, we will make a random quote & english word generator.

## How you will build it? 💻
- Our quote generator will need to use the useEffect hook to perform a "side effect" to fetch the quotes from an external API. After fetching our quotes, we will put them in our local app state, which we will call quotes.

- We'll then take that array of quotes and use a function to select a random item within that array. Then we'll put it in another state variable called just quote, which can then be displayed to our user.

- We also want to add a "New Quote" button above each quote that will perform the same operation – get a new random quote from our quotes array and put it in quote.

- Finally, the quote isn't loaded in state. So we'll make sure to use the optional chaining operator (?) to safely check our object before we attempt to get a value from that quote in state to make sure our app doesn't throw an error.

- Same process as above for getting English words from external API & Call one more API for getting word Definition.

## React concepts you will learn 📝
- useEffect (to perform side effects)
- HTTP requests with Fetch API
- Passing data to components via props
- Conditional chaining operator (?)
